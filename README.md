# Amazon Clone
---

This project was done to practice the basic frontend development skills using **HTML, CSS and JS**. The project was to make only the landing page of Amazon.com so it is not to be expected to visit other pages by clicking on any links present on the home page, clicking the same would most likely to give a *page not found* error.
